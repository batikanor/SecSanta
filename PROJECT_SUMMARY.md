npm install  # Already done
npm run dev
```

## 🎬 Quick Demo Script (3 minutes)

### Minute 1: Problem & Demo Start
> "Group gifting lacks privacy AND transparency. SecSanta uses blockchain
> to hide contribution amounts until finalization, then reveals everything.
> Plus, ENS makes it human-friendly. Let me show you..."

**Action**: Connect wallet, show ENS name displays

### Minute 2: Create & Join Pool
**User 1**: Create pool with `vitalik.eth` as recipient
- Show ENS auto-resolution
- Show beautiful ENS name display

**User 2**: Join pool
- Show contribution is hidden
- Show progress (2/3)

**User 3**: Join pool
- Pool auto-finalizes!
- All amounts revealed

### Minute 3: Technical Highlights
> "We integrated ENS deeply - both forward and reverse resolution.
> Built with Next.js 14, Wagmi v2, RainbowKit. Clean code, ready for
> production. Open source, well-documented."

**Show**: GitHub repo, component code, ENS hooks
