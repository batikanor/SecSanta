# ETHRome 2025 - Bounty Strategy

## 🎯 Target Bounties

This SecSanta project is strategically designed to qualify for multiple bounties at ETHRome 2025.

### 1. ENS Bounty - $5,000 💰

**Requirements**: Best use of ENS

**Our Implementation**:
- ✅ **ENSDisplay Component** (`fe/components/ENSDisplay.tsx`)
  - Uses `useEnsName` hook from wagmi
  - Displays ENS names when available
  - Graceful fallback to truncated addresses
  - Works in both DEBUG and production modes

- ✅ **ENSInput Component** (`fe/components/ENSInput.tsx`)
  - Uses `useEnsAddress` hook from wagmi
  - Accepts both ENS names and Ethereum addresses
  - Real-time ENS resolution
  - Shows resolved address for validation

- ✅ **Full Integration**
  - ENS used throughout the app (dashboard, pool details, contributors)
  - Enhanced UX with human-readable names
  - Mainnet ENS resolution (chainId: 1)

**Demo Points**:
- Show creating a pool with `vitalik.eth` as recipient
- Display how ENS names appear instead of addresses
- Demonstrate ENS input auto-resolution

### 2. BuidlGuidl (Scaffold-ETH) - $2,000 💰

**Requirements**: Top dapps built using modern Web3 stack

**Our Implementation**:
- ✅ **Next.js 14** with App Router
- ✅ **TypeScript** for type safety
- ✅ **RainbowKit** for wallet connection
- ✅ **Wagmi v2** with React hooks
- ✅ **Viem** for Ethereum interactions
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS** for styling

**Code Quality**:
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Type-safe interfaces
- Professional UI/UX
- Comprehensive README

**Demo Points**:
- Show smooth wallet connection
- Demonstrate type-safe contract interactions (when backend ready)
- Highlight code organization and reusability

### 3. Base Miniapp - Social ($5,000) 💰

**Requirements**: Miniapps with viral social mechanics

**Our Implementation**:
- ✅ **Social-First Design**
  - Group gifting mechanics
  - Shareable pool links
  - Friend collaboration features

- ✅ **Viral Mechanics**
  - Pool sharing with copy link
  - Social proof (contributor list)
  - FOMO factor (threshold countdown)

- ✅ **Miniapp-Ready Architecture**
  - Lightweight frontend
  - Can be adapted for Farcaster Frames
  - Mobile-responsive design
  - No complex dependencies

**Adaptation Strategy**:
If targeting this bounty, we can:
1. Create Farcaster Frame integration
2. Add social sharing buttons
3. Implement notification system
4. Add leaderboards/rankings

---

### 4. Additional Opportunities

#### Privacy/Confidential Computing Bounties

**Potential Targets**:
- **iExec ($6,000)**: Confidential DeFi with TEE
- **Zama ($5,000)**: FHE for hidden contributions
- **Enclave ($2,000)**: Confidential voting/pooling

**Our Use Case**:
- Hidden contribution amounts until finalization
- Anonymous gifting
- Privacy-preserving group coordination

**Integration Path** (if teammate wants to add):
1. Use TEE/FHE to encrypt contribution amounts
2. Reveal only when threshold is met
3. Maintain privacy while ensuring verifiable execution

---

## 📊 Bounty Prioritization

### Tier 1 (High Confidence)
1. **ENS ($5k)**: ✅ Fully implemented, ready to demo
2. **BuidlGuidl ($2k)**: ✅ Modern stack, clean code

### Tier 2 (Medium Effort)
3. **Base Miniapp ($5k)**: Requires Farcaster integration (achievable)

### Tier 3 (Requires Backend/Team)
4. **Privacy bounties ($2k-$6k)**: Needs smart contract integration

---

## 🎬 Demo Strategy

### For Judges - 3-Minute Pitch

**Minute 1: Problem & Solution**
> "Gift pooling is common, but current solutions lack privacy and transparency.
> SecSanta uses blockchain for transparent finalization while keeping
> contributions private until the pool is complete. ENS makes it human-friendly."

**Minute 2: Live Demo**
1. Connect wallet → Shows ENS name (e.g., "alice.eth")
2. Create pool → Enter "vitalik.eth" as recipient (shows auto-resolution)
3. Show dashboard → Multiple pools with ENS names
4. Join pool → Demonstrate threshold finalization
5. View finalized pool → Show revealed contributions

**Minute 3: Technical Highlights**
- ENS integration (both hooks: useEnsName, useEnsAddress)
- Modern Web3 stack (Next.js, Wagmi v2, RainbowKit)
- Clean architecture ready for production
- Optional: Privacy features (if implemented)

### Key Talking Points

**For ENS Bounty**:
- "We integrated ENS throughout the entire app, not just wallet connection"
- "Users can enter 'vitalik.eth' and we automatically resolve it"
- "See how much better UX is with names instead of addresses"

**For BuidlGuidl**:
- "Built with Scaffold-ETH principles: modern stack, clean code"
- "TypeScript for safety, Wagmi v2 for latest features"
- "Easy for other devs to fork and build on"

**For Base Miniapp** (if pursuing):
- "Designed for viral sharing - each pool member invites friends"
- "Mobile-first, works in Farcaster frames"
- "Social gifting creates natural growth loops"
